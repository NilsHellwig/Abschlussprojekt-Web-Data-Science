# Some Notes


1. For both `/01 flight delay prediction` and `/02 flight tweets delay analysis`, I recommend starting with the notebook named with the prefix "01". There is a corresponding .html file for each notebook containing all outputs.

2. My datasets were too large for GRIPS (> 100MB as a .zip file). Additionally, I wasn't able to upload plots/results (flight delay classification performance for each month in the form of .csv-files) due to the upload limitation on GRIPS of 20 files.

Therefore, you can download the datasets/plots/results from here:

3. Furthermore, the entire code (except for /datasets) is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/NilsHellwig/Abschlussprojekt-Web-Data-Science
