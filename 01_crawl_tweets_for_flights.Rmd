First, we can load all the departures

```{r}
departure_data <- read.csv("datasets/departure_dataset.csv")
```

Now I can load all the possible values for column $flight_number to collect all tweets for each flight number

```{r}
flight_numbers <- unique(departure_data$flight_number)
for (flight in flight_numbers[0:10]) {
  print(flight)
}
```
